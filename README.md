# Chernoff-face-manipulation
Chernoff face manipulation in Mathematica.
<br/>
<br/>
A Chernoff face is a simple sketch of a human face that is parameterized by a few variables. By manipulating the variables, it is possible to achieve a wide range of expressions. Program is written to manipulate various features of an image with sliders as well as make it react in response to Hip hop music.
